Creating a landing page for The Odin Project

This is a landing page practice project that I developed with The Odin Project.

Instead of placeholder images, I decided to use pictures of my family.

The top picture is my wife and I with our third child, Hudson.

The pictures from left to right are Konner, Matthew, Hudson and Noah.

I kept some of the placeholder information just to keep this streamlined.

I also changed the links and added functionality to the buttons, directing the user to www.google.com

Please feel free to let me know if there's anything I can do to better improve the site.  I'm still learning and very much a novice.  Thanks!
